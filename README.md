This project is created for Practical Machine Learning Coursera project.

Abstract

There a lot of wearable devices today which are used to analyse the activities of humans. Some of those devices are Fitbit, Apple watch, Nike FuelBand etc. This devices help people to carefully monitor their activities and exercises to maintain their health. The given dataset contained some sensors measurements of 6 participants who have exercised barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly 5 times. In this project, I have predicted the values of classe variable by analyzing through accuracy of various Machine learning algorithm preformance on the dataset.
